What does one say about a book that describes the politics, philosophy, and thoughts of a man who was one of the last of a breed of literary and intellect ual lions? That this is a wonderful interpretation, full of fresh snippets of information and illuminating quotes and nuggets regarding a fiery and powerfully opinionated man who typified w hat the word \\"character\\" once meant. These days we have plenty of celebrities who are characters, but Scott Nearing had character. Scott Nearing was that rare and precious kind of man w ho actually stood by what he believed in, making his actions consistent with his beliefs, and doing so paid a terrible price for shouting against the insanity of the 20th century. Were we e ver to look for good models to socialize our young with, Scott Nearing would be at the head of the line, standing shoulder to shoulder with other better known men like Gandhi, as wonderful  models of what meaningful adulthood can look like.<br /><br />I first learned about Scott and Helen Nearing in the late 1960s from a friend who was interested in learning more about the bac k-to-the-land movement of subsistence farming. Like many of the other baby boomers infatuated with anything different and unusual, I quickly steeped myself in the lore of the Nearings. What  I found has long since fascinated and amazed me. Scott Nearing was an idealistic socialist, an outspoken reformer teaching at the University of Pennsylvania before the First World War who  was suddenly removed from his position because of his strong and public opposition to the shames of child labor. His long and tortured personal odyssey from the moment of that removal seeme d destined to cast him further and further from the center of the political firestorm raging in this country and closer and closer to nature and an alternative lifestyle. Finally by the ear ly 1930s, in the midst of the Depression, he and his young wife Helen arrived in rural Vermont to buy a ramshackle old farm and attempt to live a more deliberative, purposeful, and balanced  lifestyle that was consistent with their philosophy and social politics.<br /><br />This is a well-written, accessible and eminently readable book by an academic who has done all of his ho mework. From  extensive interviews not only with Nearing but also with an impressive gallary of 20th century intellectual notables, including a staggering list of luminaries who knew Nearin g and his work, Mr. Whitfield weaves a substantial and complex intelectuall and politically sensitive portrait of a man whose social and philosophical appraoch was based on Marxian realpoli tik; a man who lived a life of principle with integrity, good humor, and compassion. Scott Nearing stands as a modern American icon from whom we can all learn a better and more satisfying w ay to approach our own lives and our won personal responsibilities to the wider community surrounding us. This is an absorbing and worthwhile boo, and one many of your friends would come to  treasure after being introduced to this Spencer Tracy look-alike who so influenced a whole generation of younger Americans now living the 'good life'. Enjoy.erative, purposeful, and balanc ed lifestyle that was consistent with their philosophy and social politics.

I know it may seem a bit early in the calendar year to be talking about buying a 2006 calendar, but all too soon your son or daughter will be on h is or her way to college, and a calendar that serves for the whole academic year serves them well in planning for the whole year. Besides, the photos in this one are so awesome that I wante d to mention it, for you can literally cut the photos out after using the calendar and frame them. There are a variety of shots, all taken by professionals, and they all add together to con tribute to the overall charm and attractiveness of the calendar. I have one in the kitchen, so as I am feeding my hoarde of five dogs I can glance up to see even more Labs staring back at m e from the wall. At any rate, this is a wonderful calender, and it is certainly one I can heartily recommend for your matriculating student. If you have a Lab at home, this calendar will pr ovide a comforting presence in that otherwise drab dormitory room for the homesick kid. Enjoy!    2005-08-17

Although his name has never become a household word recognized by the average Joe, former Mr. Universe Bill Pearl is easily one of the greatest co mpetitive bodybuilders of all time, having won the Mr. America title as well as both the Amateur and Professional NABBA Mr. Universe titles, the latter several times.  Back in the days befo re muscle-magazine magnate Joe Weider created the Mr. Olympia title as a venue for former Mr. Universe winners to continue to compete in the world of professional bodybuilding, the NABBA Pr ofessional Mr. Universe title was the place where they strove against each other in a battle of egos and physiques. In this arena Pearl was never defeated, and there is considerable specula tion as to whether he or Arnold Schwarzenegger would have emerged victorious had they competed as planned in the fall of 1970. Arnold was game, but passed by the contest on instructions fro m Weider, who wanted to avoid the possibility that Schwarzenegger might lose and thus the Weider-sponsored IFBB version of the Mr. Universe contest would have been discredited.<br /><br />S o the fabled match-up never occurred, and there are various schools of thought regarding whose physique was superior. Regardless, there is no question that Pearl, who was always a consummat e gentleman and great competitor, was fully up to the task. Pearl's life, as told here in terms of anecdotes, streams of photographs, and a number of diverting narratives by Pearl himself,  is as congenial and multifaceted as Pearl himself. From the very beginning, Bill Pearl was a man with many talents and a great number of interests, and when not building his incredible arms  and shoulders he was just as likely to be found in other amiable pursuits ranging from playing musical instruments to building a series of successful business ventures.
